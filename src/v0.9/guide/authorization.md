Currently `json-api-resources` doesn't come with built-in primitives for authorization. However multiple users of the framework have come up with different approaches, check out:

- [jsonapi-authorization](https://github.com/venuu/jsonapi-authorization)
- [pundit-resources](https://github.com/togglepro/pundit-resources)

Refer to the comments/discussion [here](https://github.com/cerebris/jsonapi-resources/issues/16#issuecomment-222438975) for the differences between approaches
